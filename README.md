# 2023 JavaScript NZ committee election

The time has come to elect the JavaScript NZ committee members for 2023.

Elections will take place at the JavaScript NZ AGM on Thursday the 10th of August at 7pm NZDT on [the society Slack, in the #society-agm channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T09HZENRK/C01DXP02NHX).

## Nomination process

To nominate, [open an issue](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/committee-election/issues/new) with the **name of the person you wish to nominate** (this **can** be yourself) and the **position you wish to nominate them/yourself for**. 

Every nomination needs a second from another member of JavaScript NZ. If you aren't sure who can second your nomination, ask in [the Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T09HZENRK/C09HZBW14) (you can join the Slack community [here](https://javascript.org.nz/slack)). To second a nomination, comment on the issue where they were nominated. 

**All** the positions are open for election at the AGM, even if they are currently held.

Any member of JavaScript NZ can be nominated to the committee. As new memberships are currently suspended, if you are not currently a member, you can be added to the membership rolls after the election.
