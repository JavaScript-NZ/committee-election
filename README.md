# 2020 JavaScript NZ committee election

The time has come to elect the JavaScript NZ committee members for 2020 (the AGM has been a bit delayed this year due to the lockdown). 

Elections will take place at the JavaScript NZ AGM on Thursday the 29th of October 2020 at 7pm NZDT on google hangouts - a link will be supplied closer to the date.

## Nomination process

Any member of JavaScript NZ can be nominated to the committee. If you are not currently a member [you can join](https://javascript.org.nz/join).

To nominate, [open an issue](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/committee-election/issues/new) with the **name of the person you wish to nominate** (this **can** be yourself) and the **position you wish to nominate them/yourself for**. 

Every nomination needs a second from another member of JavaScript NZ. If you aren't sure who can second your nomination, ask in [the Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T09HZENRK/C09HZBW14) (you can join the Slack community [here](https://javascript.org.nz/slack)). To second a nomination, comment on the issue where they were nominated. 

All the positions are open for election at the AGM, even if they are currently held.
